# Machine Learning-based Ransomware Detection

This project is my Senior Capstone at the University of North Georgia.  
It aims to build a machine learning system that detects ransomware activity by analyzing system and network logs.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Ransomware remains one of the most disruptive forms of cybercrime, often leaving organizations with financial and operational damage.

The goal of this project is to:

- Train ML models on **static log data** to classify ransomware vs. benign activity.
- Normalize and preprocess logs for consistent feature extraction.
- Evaluate performance using multiple metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
- Compare results across different models (Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, etc.).

Tools & Libraries:

- Python 3.10+
- scikit-learn
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn (for analysis)
